# Overview

Many projects start with an existing database definition, making best practices difficult to implement. This project is intended to provide code samples, patterns, and practices that can be reused in such projects. Ultimately, I want to reduce the time it takes to pivot legacy or badly designed solutions into something more maintainable in a shorter length of time than rewriting or refactoring from scratch.

### Goals

- Separate concerns to increase Unit Test coverage
- Allow extension at any layer with minimal impact in other layers in the solution
- Explore Functional Programming concepts to minimize code and increase DRYness. 
- Explore Asyncrhonous C#
- Provide generic fallbacks at each layer to cover simple CRUD operations
  - Only code custom interactions, try to genericize as many code paths as possible. 

### Dependencies

- AdventureWorks2016 Database
  - [Github Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works)
  - [Documentation](https://dataedo.com/download/AdventureWorks.pdf)
- [Automapper](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper)
- .NET Core 2.1

### Terms

Term | Meaning |
--- | --- |
Domain | For this example, synonymous with Database. Contains the Database Tables as DomainEntities |
Entity / DomainEntity | Synonymous with the Database Table. Ex: `Customer` and `Address` Entities and Tables are separate |
Model | The data as it is needed by a consumer of the data, usually a service. Ex: A combined `CustomerWithAddressModel` |
Repository | A wrapper around the Domain. Provides ETL / Mapping logic for Entity <-> Domain translations. |
Service | Contains Business Logic about a specific Model. Potentially composited of multiple Repositories. |



## Architecture Layers

This pattern is loosely based on [this article.](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/onion-architecture-in-asp-net-core-mvc/)

### Domain Layer

The Source of Truth or System of Record. The database definition. For the purpose of this project, it is an EntityFrameworkCore DbContext with each SQL Schema represented by an associated folder and namespace. This enables Code-First to be used going forward, or you can continue with Database-First. This layer is similar to the traditional DAL or Data Access Layer, though stripped down.

- Only define _what_ the Database Entities (tables) look like
- _Do not_ define how the database interacts with data (BLL)
- Only the Repository Layer should know about anything in this layer.

### Repository Layer

This layer provides an abstraction between the data at rest (in the Database) and in use (in the Application Services layer). AutoMapper is used to provide a streamlined way of defining data projections of Entities over Models. 

- Provide a repository pattern over the Domain Layer
- Handle mapping or ETL logic
  - Transform data form "At-Rest" to "In-Use" formats, and vice-versa
- Dependent on Domain Layer
- Only the Services Layer should be dependent on this layer.

### Service Layer

Provides services that map one-for-one to business use cases. This layer may use compositional inheritance to provide a facade to multiple Repositories. This layer is synonymous with the traditional BLL or Business Logic Layer. 

- Isolate Business Logic (how something is done)
- Provide a flexible extension point for additional business logic / requirements
- Provide a generic fallback service with simple CRUD operations
- ToDo: Explore functional programming concepts in this layer particularly

### UI Layer

Exactly what you'd expect. The presentation layer. This layer may be implemented in a separate repository where I explore different options for implementation. In the case of an SPA, this layer will most likely be an API endpoint that exposes the Service Layer for direct interaction with a client. 

- Provides users with a way to manipulate data
- ToDo: Provide Vue, Angular, and MVC samples


## Roadmap

- Generic UI implementation
- Custom JSON Serializer/Converter
- MVC Razor UI
- Vue.js UI
- Angular UI
- ???
